-------------------------
Varnish Throttling Module
-------------------------

:Author: Dag Haavi Finstad

:Version: 1.0
:Manual section: 3

SYNOPSIS
========

import vsthrottle;

DESCRIPTION
===========

A Varnish vmod for rate-limiting traffic on a single Varnish
server. Offers a simple interface for throttling traffic on a per-key
basis to a specific request rate.

Keys can be specified from any VCL string, e.g. based on client.ip, a
specific cookie value, an API token, etc.

The request rate is specified as the number of requests permitted over
a period. To keep things simple, this is passed as two separate
parameters, 'limit' and 'period'.

This VMOD implements a `token-bucket algorithm`_. State associated
with the token bucket for each key is stored in-memory using BSD's
red-black tree implementation.

Memory usage is around 100 bytes per key tracked.

.. _token-bucket algorithm: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket


FUNCTIONS
=========

is_denied
---------

Prototype
        ::

                is_denied(STRING key, INT limit, DURATION period)
Arguments
	key: A unique identifier to define what is being throttled - more examples below
	
	limit: How many requests in the specified period
	
	period: The time period
	
Return value
	BOOL
Description
	Can be used to rate limit the traffic for a specific key to a
	maximum of 'limit' requests per 'period' time.
Example
        ::

		sub vcl_recv {
			if (vsthrottle.is_denied(client.identity, 15, 10s)) {
				# Client has exceeded 15 reqs per 10s
				return (synth(429, "Too Many Requests"));
			}

			# ...
		}


INSTALLATION
============

To be able to compile this vmod, varnish 4 must be installed,
and the source tree must be locally available.

The source tree is based on autotools to configure the building, and
does also have the necessary bits in place to do functional unit tests
using the varnishtest tool.

Pre-installation configuration::

 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure VARNISHSRC=DIR [VMODDIR=DIR]

`VARNISHSRC` is the directory of the Varnish source tree for which to
compile your vmod. Both the `VARNISHSRC` and `VARNISHSRC/include`
will be added to the include search paths for your module.

Optionally you can also set the vmod install directory by adding
`VMODDIR=DIR` (defaults to the pkg-config discovered directory from your
Varnish installation).

Make and install the vmod::
 
 make           # builds the vmod
 make install   # installs your vmod in `VMODDIR`
 make check     # runs the unit tests in ``src/tests/*.vtc``
 
The libvmod-vsthrottle vmod will now be available in your VMODDIR and can be copied to other systems as required.

 
USAGE
=====

In your VCL you can now use this vmod along the following lines::
        
        import vsthrottle;
        
        sub vcl_recv {
        	if (vsthrottle.is_denied(client.identity, 15, 10s)) {
        	# Client has exceeded 15 reqs per 10s
        	return (synth(429, "Too Many Requests"));
        	}
        }
